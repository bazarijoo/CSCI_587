In this assignment, I implemented [DCRNN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.01926) model for traffic forecasting. The goal of this assignment was not to reproduce the results of the paper (difference in experimental settings exist), but to compare how different adjacency matrices (road network, euclidean, identity) perform differently for traffic forecasting. . All the data in `data` directory are from DCRNN [repository](https://github.com/liyaguang/DCRNN/).
